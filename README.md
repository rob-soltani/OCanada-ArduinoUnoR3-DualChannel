# O Canada: For Arduino Uno R3 (double-line melody)

**O Canada**; encoded to play as a double-line melody on two passive buzzers using PWM on Arduino Uno R3.


### The YouTube Video of the Project
You can watch a video I made of this project at https://youtu.be/huY1Py63rSA.


### Details
The **OCanada-ArduinoUnoR3-DualChannel.ino** file is heavily commented.

I appreciate feedback.
Please let me know if I can make any improvements or if there are any errors in either my code or my interpretation of the notes.

### Why?
This is what I submitted as my last lab assignment in the **Computer Organization II** course, which was part of my undergraduate computer science studies at **Ryerson University**. Following the sheet music, I encoded the single-line melody using the C constants of buzzer frequencies in a header file provided by the course instructor.

I used the Arduino Uno R3 board, made by Elegoo, one small breadboard, a passive buzzer, and two jumper cables from the kit (details below).

I also used an I/O Trainer Board V1.1 made by Curious Circuits  (details below).
